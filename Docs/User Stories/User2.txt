User Story 2 - Logged in user

Refer to user1 for login story.

A logged in user should be able to access their saved locations and routes and select from these to find a route without needing to type in an address. The user can also type in a new address for start or destination as well as use location services for start and potentially save it as a favorite location for later access. 

The routes that are shown will be sortable either by transit time or transit price.
