User Story 3 - Non-logged in user


Update:

The initial user story is technically true, but it should also be pointed out that the functionality for a logged-in user to save locations and access previous locations and routes has not yet been implemented. 










--------------------------------------------------------------------------
User who is not logged in will have access to all the functionality of the app EXCEPT being able to:
 - save locations
 - access previous locations and routes
